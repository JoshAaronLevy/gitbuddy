# GitBuddy - Your Best Git Friend

GitBuddy is an interactive CLI that provides simple prompts for common git commands. Prompts make it easy to stage a select groups of files, to help build good git habits, or break bad ones. Shorthand options allow you to easily skip through steps. And it returns clean, semantic responses throughout the process.
